# ShippingCalculator

Contains the implementation of a shipping calculator given a file of
transactions and returning the list with the applied discounts.

The discount follow these rules:

* All S shipments should always match the lowest S package price among the providers.
* The third L shipment via LP should be free, but only once a calendar month.
* Accumulated discounts cannot exceed 10 â‚¬ in a calendar month. If there are
  not enough funds to fully cover a discount this calendar month, it should be
  covered partially.

Prices are included in the code.
